### Frontend

The frontend component is written in JSReact and can be deployed locally for development purposes. For information on running the app locally in a development environment, see the README.md file in the frontend directory. To run the app in a production environment, see the instructions in VizIoT Installation markdown file.

### Backend

The backend component is written in Javascript. To run the backend component, see the documentation in the VizIoT Installation markdown file.

### Pypcap

The pypcap-monitor is written in Python with several actions automated in bash scripts. To run the pypcap-monitor, see the documentation in the VizIoT Installation markdown file.

## Additional Documentation

To customize the VizIoT application, see the VizIoT Documentation markdown file. For specific information regarding each component, view the README markdown files in the respective directory for each component.
